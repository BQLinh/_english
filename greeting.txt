* Tell me about your recent/ last/ favorite project? (What was your team size? What did you do? What was your role? What technologies did you use?)
My last project is about export a report file about japanese population. We only have 2 developers, 1 tester and 1 bridge software engineer.
We use Django Rest Framework to create apis and connect to database. For complex queries, we use raw queries. My role is create tables for the database, write apis, implement functions. 
I need to read documentations of japanese to get distance between locations and documents about a asposecell tools to convert excel to pdf.


* What is the most challenging in the project?
There are some problems while we developed the project. Some documentations are written in Japanese, so its hard for us to understand. We need to try to understand it by translate it to 
english and practice to understand those apis. 
The second problem is, apis for python is implement from java apis, so its lack apis compare with python, sometimes, we couldn't change style of excel files. To overcome this problems, we need to read alot document about Asposecell for java and change style of the template file
